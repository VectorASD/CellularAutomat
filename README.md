Game of Life

Type "make run" to start the game.

In case it didn't work, make sure that "freetype-2.12.1.tar.bz" archive extracted into your game folder.

Then type following commands: "sudo apt-get install libglew-dev" and "sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev".

If it still doesn't work, try to type following commands: "cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"" and "sudo apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev".
