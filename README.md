First, type following commands: "sudo apt-get install libglew-dev" and "sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev"
Type "make run" to start the game.
In case it didn't work, try to extract "freetype-2.12.1.tar.bz" archive into your game folder.
If it still doesn't work, try to type following commands: "cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"" and 
"sudo apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev".
